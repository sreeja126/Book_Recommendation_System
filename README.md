## Approach

The idea is to build a recommender system using content-based filtering technique. This recommendation technique utilizes the item features to generate recommendations based on content similarity.

The system combines 'authors', 'categories' and 'description' features and uses cosine similarity to compute similarities between the books.

Word2Vec embedding technique is used to generate word embeddings and thus calculate simlarity between items.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or above
* Streamlit
